# Starter Templates

To save you a bit of time over setting up your environment for the take-home, this repo provides you with three starter templates to get started.

Feel free to fork this repo, and change it however you like. You can also totally ignore this repo and do your own thing. This is just set up with Vite, and if you want to do the same thing on your own you can [follow the instructions in the Vite documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/).

There are the options of React, Svelte, and Vue. Once in the directory, you can get it started by running:

``` bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Looking forward to seeing your work, cheers!
